# crud

Simple CRUD with simple Javascript graph database.

## DB principles

A node is whatever object to which were added technical fields:

* `gdbid`: a unique ID,
* `gdbvalid`: a validity indicator,
* `gdbuser`: the user that created it,
* `gdbdate`: the date of creation of the node (not the object).
